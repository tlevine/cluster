Tom's Beaglebone cluster
=========
Here are configuration instructions for Tom's Beaglebone cluster. There's also
a mock-up of an interface he might like (`bone.md`).

## Hardware
Hardware for the worker nodes

* Beaglebones
* Router
* Switch
* 5-volt power supply (Everything takes 5 volts.)
* Some magic case

The master could just be a laptop, but I could also build it in.

* Keyboard
* Mouse
* Mini-ITX or micro-ATX board
* Portable monitor


### Portable monitors
Here are some ideas. They all use USB.

* [9", 1 lb](http://www.doublesight.com/product/?idx=53)
* [16", 2.3 lbs](http://us.aoc.com/monitor_displays/e1649fwu)
* [22", 6 lbs](http://www.walmart.com/ip/EPI-E2251FWU/20581019?sourceid=1500000000000003183800&veh=cse&srccode=cii_11816&cpncode=33-7301595)

### Cases
Some things others have done:

* [Milwaukee hackspace](http://milwaukeemakerspace.org/2011/03/computer-case/) (Consider the center of gravity.)
* [Pelican](http://www.pelicanonline-ralphs.com/top-8-modified-pelican-cases.htm)

Ideas for me:

* It can be for just storage of things that get set up outside the case.
* Those tilting wall-mount monitor plates might be nice.
* How do I mount my beaglebones?
* Use one or two of my spare fans.

In case I want to just attach a bunch of standard Beaglebone cases,
[here](http://elinux.org/BeagleBone#Cases) are some ideas.
[This one](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:19153) looks perfect.

### Hardware for the master

Maybe I just install a more powerful operating system with an image that someone already made for
[Gentoo](http://www.chromebook-linux.com/2011/11/gentoo-is-ready-for-chromebook.html) or
[Debian](http://www.chromebook-linux.com/2011/11/how-to-install-gnulinux-debian-603-on.html)?

If not, maybe it can just be a beaglebone with a bigger microSD card?

Maybe I can get that cheap netbook working.

* [Arch Linux on a WM8650 Netbook](http://kernelhacks.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/arch-linux-on-wm8650-netbook.html)
* [Arch Linux on a WM8650 Netbook II](http://kernelhacks.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/arch-linux-on-wm8650-netbook-ii.html)
* [Porting Arch Linux to a WM8650 tablet](http://pond-weed.com/wmt8650/index.html)

Otherwise,

* [Intel D2700DC Fanless Atom Mini-ITX Board](http://www.mini-itx.com/store/?c=47#D525MW)
* [Case](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:13080)
* I have a PicoPSU.
