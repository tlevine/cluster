Tom's Beaglebone cluster
=========
Here are configuration instructions for Tom's Beaglebone cluster. There's also
a mock-up of an interface he might like (`bone.md`).

## Hardware
Hardware for the worker nodes

* Beaglebones
* Router
* Switch
* 5-volt power supply (Everything takes 5 volts.)
* Some magic case

The master could just be a laptop, but I could also build it in.

* Keyboard
* Mouse
* Mini-ITX or micro-ATX board
* Portable monitor


### Portable monitors
Here are some ideas. They all use USB.

* [9", 1 lb](http://www.doublesight.com/product/?idx=53)
* [16", 2.3 lbs](http://us.aoc.com/monitor_displays/e1649fwu)
* [22", 6 lbs](http://www.walmart.com/ip/EPI-E2251FWU/20581019?sourceid=1500000000000003183800&veh=cse&srccode=cii_11816&cpncode=33-7301595)

### Cases
Some things others have done:

* [Milwaukee hackspace](http://milwaukeemakerspace.org/2011/03/computer-case/) (Consider the center of gravity.)
* [Pelican](http://www.pelicanonline-ralphs.com/top-8-modified-pelican-cases.htm)

Ideas for me:

* It can be for just storage of things that get set up outside the case.
* Those tilting wall-mount monitor plates might be nice.
* How do I mount my beaglebones?

In case I want to just attach a bunch of standard Beaglebone cases,
[here](http://elinux.org/BeagleBone#Cases) are some ideas.
